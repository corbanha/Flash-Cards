# Flash-Cards
Console flash card reviewer in Java that I used quite extensively in high school 

This is a console program written in Java. It stores files of the words or phrases that you want to memorize and keeps track of how well you do as you review them. It will periodically remove "experience" over time so that you can keep up to date with all of the cards in your deck. Supports multiple decks and other nice features.
